# Creating an Account

In order to create an account you should go the [Register Page](http://www.aluna.social/register) and fill a simple form with username, email and password.

Once you have registered a confirmation email will be sent but you don't have
to confirm your email to start using the platform but it's important users
confirm their emails in case they want to recover their password later.

Once you have registered you can login on the dashboard from any device by
navigating to the [Login Page](http://www.aluna.social/login).
