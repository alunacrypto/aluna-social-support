# Insights

The first thing you will notice when arriving at [Aluna Social](https://aluna.social)
is what we call "insights".

Insights work pretty much like Twitter in the sense that anyone can write a
small post and all the followers will see this post on their timeline.

But they're different from Twitter in the sense that you can't delete the
insights posts, therefore user's are incentivised to only post information
that they believe are relevant and they can stand behind.

Insights containing cashtags or hashtags will be linked to any relevant market page.

The homepage also show the best and worst performing trades, the best and worst
performance markets and also the most followed users.

The global timeline also display trades being placed by the community in real
time.
