# Insights

The first thing you will notice when arriving at [Aluna Social](aluna.social) 
are community insights.

Insights work pretty much like Twitter in the sense that anyone can write a
small post and all the followers will see this post on their timeline.

The main difference and advantage insights have over twitter is the fact that
any cashtags or hashtags will be linked to the user's public profile and also
to any relevant market page. 

This allows you not only to check what people are thinking about the markets
but also double check their profiles to see if they're really invested or even
margin trading in any market.

When acessing the homepage from your desktop you will also see other information
such as the most profitable margin positions at the moment, or the best performing
crypto today.
