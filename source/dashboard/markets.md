# Markets

Our markets page displays an overview of what is happening in the markets at
the moment.

Clicking on a coin will take your to our Coin Page, where you will be able
to see the Price Chart and Order Form as well insights posted by the community.

We also show a list of users holding the coin you're looking at as well a list
of people with Margin Positions open at the moment.

For instance, if you looking at a BTC chart, you will be seeing all insights
with cashtag $BTC, as well a list of profiles who own BTC or are long or short
in any BTC market.
