# Social

The Social page currently works as a public list of profiles who wish to share
their trades with other people they might not know.

Every user has their own public page which is accessible for any other user
logged in the website, users not wanting to be listed on the Social page 
can disable this option on the Settings page.

It's worth noticing if someone you follow is listed on the Social page your
profile will be visible through their list of followers.
