### Connecting Exchange Accounts

In order to link your Exchange Accounts to the Dashboard you will have to
go to the [Settings Page](https://aluna.social/settings) and update them there.

Below each Exchange API and SECRET fields there will be a link to the respective
exchange API KEY Settings Page so you can easily generate new ones.

Once you have connected the exchange you will be able to access your Balances,
Positions, Orders and manage your accounts directly from our [Telegram bot](../bot/intro.md) and from
the [Dashboard](./intro.md)

The platform is currently compatible with the following exchanges

### 1Broker

If you are already familiar with [1Broker.com](https://1broker.com/?r=44749),
feel free to skip the following explanation. But for those of you who are new
to [1Broker.com](https://1broker.com/?r=44749), here's a quick intro:

[1Broker.com](https://1broker.com/?r=44749) is an online broker which allows you
to trade many Stocks, Forex, Indexes, Commodities and BTC/USD using your Bitcoins.

For example, imagine you have 1BTC and you believe Apple shares will
rise in the following days, you could then go to [1Broker.com](https://1broker.com/?r=44749)
and "invest" 1BTC in Apple shares ( it's actually a [CFD](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/09/trade-a-cfd.asp) ),
if Apple rises 10% you'll then be able to close your position for a 10% profit ( minus brokerage fees )

Another example, [1Broker.com](https://1broker.com/?r=44749) allows you to
leverage your trades, effectively multiplying the movement of the underlying
asset.

Imagine you buy 1BTC in Apple Shares with 2X Leverage, if Apple goes 10% up
you will effectively bank 20%, if apple share value drops by 5% then you will
loose 10%. Sounds complicated? I bet it doesn't!
