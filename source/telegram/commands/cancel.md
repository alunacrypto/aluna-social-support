# /cancel

This command allows you cancel and Open Order.

There is only one parameter needed :
 - order number - The Unique Order Number

``` bash
/cancel 1234
```

The [/cancel](./cancel.md) command works the same way on all exchanges hence why you don't
need to specify the exchange where you want to cancel your order.

In order to know the Order Number you should see your orders by executing the
[/orders](./orders.md) command.
