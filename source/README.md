## What is Aluna Social?

[Aluna Social](https://aluna.social) allows users to share information about
their trades and insights on the cryptocurrency markets.

Users can connect their exchanges accounts using API KEYS provided by the
exchanges in order to share their trades and also manage multiple exchange
accounts from an unified user interface.

In order to register on Aluna Social users only need to provie email and 
password therefore not necessarily uncovering their real names or accounts.

Every user on Aluna have a public profile where non sensitive information
is made public. Users can see your portfolio distribution but can't see 
how much of each crypto you own.

Also positions open on margin or future markets will be shared, other users
will be able to see your open price, base price and PnL% but not what your
position size is.

You're the only one who will be able to see your sensitive information, such
as balance, orders and PnL on your positions.

Users who chose to connect API KEYS with trading permissions will also be able
to place and cancel orders and also close their positions on the market.

Soon Aluna will also be launching a LEADERBOARD and awarding users with ALN
tokens based on their monthly and also on their yearly performance.

In short, [Aluna Social](https://aluna.social) is _Social Network_ with a and 
_Trading Terminal_ which allows you to manage multiple exchange accounts from one place,
while also sharing information and browsing information provided by other users.

Aluna also provides a gamefied environment where users will be rewarded by
their performance on our leaderboard and soon also in other interesting
prediction games running on the Etherum Blockchain.
